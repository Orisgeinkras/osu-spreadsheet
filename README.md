# osu-spreadsheet
A tool used for scraping best plays from a profile from the website of the rhythm game osu! and making an XLSX file with said data.


First off I would like to say thanks to those that helped me in the osu!dev discord server, as well as those in the ppy/osu!api repository. 
osu! is owned by Dean Herbert.

This program uses python and therefore requires 2 modules: xlsxwriter and requests. Make sure that wou have those installed before attempting to run the script. 

The exported file will be called scoreExported.xlsx and should appear in the same directory as the script.
Please don't hesitate to open issues, etc. if applicable
