# osu-spreadsheet
A tool used for scraping best plays from a profile from the website of the rhythm game osu! and making an XLSX file with said data.


First off I would like to say thanks to those that helped me in the osu!dev discord server, as well as those in the ppy/osu-web repository. 
osu! is owned by Dean Herbert.

The ID input is the numbers in your profile URL. e.g. for my profile, the URL is https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10240720, the part I would input is 10240720.

The exported file will be called scoreExported.xlsx and should appear in the same directory as the script/executable.
Please don't hesitate to open issues, etc. if applicable.

Cheers!
